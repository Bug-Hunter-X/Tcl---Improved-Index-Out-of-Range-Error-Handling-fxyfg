# Tcl Index Out of Range Error Handling Improvement

This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl code involving list index handling, and shows an improved approach.

The `bug.tcl` file shows a function that checks for index errors, but only provides a generic error message.  The `bugSolution.tcl` file demonstrates a better way to handle this error, giving the user more information about the problem.

This improved handling helps with easier debugging and more robust code.
